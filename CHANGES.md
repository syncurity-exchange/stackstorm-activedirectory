## v0.1.1

- In new versions of Powershell if you load a module some text is output into 
  the stream. Pywinrm doesn't handle this gracefully and it leaks into the 
  stderr (https://github.com/diyan/pywinrm/issues/169). This version fixes
  the issue by inserting `$ProgressPreference=false` at the beginning of the
  powershell script that's being run.
